description: Although set in a dystopian future, Jesse Roarke's short story ""Ripeness
  is All"" takes its title from a line in Shakespeare's King Lear, and there is a
  sense of a kind of timeless tragedy that rises to the surface in the tale. Brief
  but beautifully written, this fable-like story underscores the fact that even the
  most wondrous technological advances don't guarantee one's happiness.
